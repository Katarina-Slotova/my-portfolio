User gets a list of match suggestions based on their preferences. They can run an advanced search selecting one or a few criteria, such as age, location or interests. The user can check other users' profiles and see if they're online, or the date and time when they were online the last time. They can also report users as ‚Äúfake accounts‚Äù and block them.

Then I set up a static IP address that I calculated using an online IP calculator. I used ping command to make extra sure the address is available. Then I configured the VM so that it's possible to connect to it only with the public key from the host system instead of a password. Then I set up a firewall, allowing only SSH, HTTP and HTTPS connections. To protect against DOS attacks, I installed Fail2ban that blocks IP addresses for a specified amount of time after several failed login attempts. Next, I wrote a script that updates packages by adding a scheduled task to crontab file and monitors changes made to the crontab file by sending an email to root. Lastly, I set up an nginx server, replaced the default website with my candy shop website and wrote a deployment script that checks for changes in the index.html file, creates a backup and deploys the modified html file.
